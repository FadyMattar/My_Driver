how do we know if the type is PUB or SUB, fmode? answer : the user calls SET_TYPE with the type input.

how to restart all seek for all subs after they finished and we rewrite?

can we write to the remaining space in the buffer if there exists subs that are not done reading?

is it possible to do release if reference counting != 0 ?  do we return error?

reference counting of what? assuming file then it should be in inode?



































are processes devices?//no
Do we have a driver and a device called pubsub that manages all devices/processes?

for each file there is a minor in inode

what functions are meant that are in string.h / stdlib/ stdio?


inode : major, minor , 
		File type  // always c 
		Permissions   // can we see each process permission aka type from here or is it for the device 
		Owner ID     // we need it bc if owner closes then we close the file aka the device dies?
		Group ID     // minor ? major ?
		Size of file  // do we need it to count how much is written? is size = bits 1000b?
		Time last accessed  
		Time last modified  
		Soft/Hard Links  // do we need them since everyone in the same group? 
		Access Control List (ACLs)  // could not find good info
		
do all processes / devices need to open file to be able to write / read since they are under the same major/minor?

how is each attribute called in inode
do we need to change properties in inode, for example permissions?



add write function
make new struct that have :{
buffer pointer 
type ( pub or sub)
}
global buffer size 255
 : index of minor 

file-> private_data = struct { buffer = null, type = arg}


init_module+clean_up module, what do we need to do?
